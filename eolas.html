Navigation column, like my home page?

<ul>
<li>Only Irish docs.  Drowned in a sea of English.  Try Googling "tine",
or "punt", "file" (link these).
Or even some words that aren't obviously English:
"luach".   Sometimes split evenly with gd: "ceist".
Or try searching for proper names "Scannell" and get only 
Irish docs back.  You can try adding common words like "agus" but
this is sub-optimal.
Most exasperating: search "Bunreacht" and the first several
hits are links to the English version.
Foras na Gaeilge in google returns www.gaeilge.ie,
which is a "choose your language" page; the Gaeilgeoir
wants the default1 page directly.
<li>Non-standard representations of fadas indexed
correctly, e.g. slaiseanna in the GAELIC-L archives, but also
instances where they're left out entirely.
<li>Non-standard spellings and misspellings indexed.  Just select
the box Focail Neamh...  Link to help.
<li>Inflected forms.  Link to help.
<li>Mutated forms. Link to help.
<li>Page ranking algorithm takes into account only
links from other Irish pages; give an example where Google ranks
a useless learners page for some common word like "Eolaiocht";
DMOZ, Mavicanet meta-search sites are essentially useless.
Only ranked highly because they are highly linked from
English domains.  Try aimsigh.com:
Even better, click "infhillte" and you get the
focloir eolaiochta from acmhainn.ie.
<li>We're in a unique position as the creator and maintainer of
nearly all advanced language technology for Irish: 
GaelSpell word list, Gramadóir, etc.
<li>Hand-curated doc db.
